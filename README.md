The healthDCAT-AP is a specialised extension of the European DCAT-AP standard, designed specifically for the healthData@EU infrastructure.

It retains the foundational structure and concepts of DCAT-AP, while incorporating additional classes and metadata elements to suit the unique needs of the health domain.

The purpose of HealthDCAT-AP is to streamline data exchange within the healthData@EU ecosystem and ensure interoperability with other EU data spaces.
